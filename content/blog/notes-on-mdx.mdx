## Why MDX

MDX lets you write Markdown with the option to drop in React components when
needed. You can keep most posts simple and still have room for interactive bits.

<Callout type="success">
MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components—
perfect for technical blogs and documentation.
</Callout>

## A tiny checklist

1. Keep content in a dedicated folder like `content/blog`.
2. Use frontmatter for title, date, and excerpt.
3. Render with a single server component.

```ts
export const getAllPosts = () => {
  return readFiles().map(parseFrontmatter);
};
```

## Custom components

You can define reusable components for things like callouts, code blocks with titles, 
and figures with captions.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure your components don't require browser APIs if you're using them in 
Server Components. Use 'use client' directives when needed.
</Callout>

## Keep it boring

Start with a clean MDX pipeline and add extras only when you need them. The less 
magic, the easier to debug.

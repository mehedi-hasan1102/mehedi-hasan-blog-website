## Highlights

- Simplified a layout to improve scanability.
- Reused a single button style across three pages.
- Cut a page load animation from 1200ms to 500ms.

<Callout type="info">
Release early, release often. Small incremental changes compound into 
significant improvements over time.
</Callout>

## Performance improvements

```ts
// Before: 1200ms animation
const animate = () => {
  setTimeout(() => complete(), 1200);
};

// After: 500ms animation
const animate = () => {
  setTimeout(() => complete(), 500);
};
```

<Callout type="success">
Performance wins have a cascade effect—faster interactions feel snappier, 
which improves perceived quality across the entire interface.
</Callout>

## What I learned

Speed is a feature, but clarity is the multiplier. When the structure is clear,
polish becomes easier and faster. Focus on shipping incrementally rather than 
chasing perfection in one massive PR.

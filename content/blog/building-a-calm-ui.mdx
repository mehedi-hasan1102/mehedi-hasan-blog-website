## Start with visual rhythm

A calm interface is not empty. It is paced. Keep spacing consistent and let
sections breathe so the eye knows where to land.

<Callout type="info">
Choose one strong type scale and commit to consistent spacing. This creates 
rhythm that guides the eye naturally through the interface.
</Callout>

- Choose one strong type scale
- Keep line lengths around 60 to 75 characters
- Use fewer, larger groups instead of many tiny cards

## Reduce competing accents

Pick one accent color and commit to it. If everything is loud, nothing is.

```css
:root {
  --accent: #22d3ee;
  --surface: #121618;
  --text: #ffffff;
}
```

<Callout type="success">
Using a single accent throughout your interface creates visual cohesion and 
reduces cognitive load for users navigating your product.
</Callout>

> The easiest way to make a UI feel calm is to remove one layer of noise.

## Ship the smallest version

Try to remove one element before you add a new one. Every pixel has a job.

<Callout type="warning">
Watch out for "feature creep" during design. Ask: Does this element serve the user's goal, 
or does it serve my ego?
</Callout>
